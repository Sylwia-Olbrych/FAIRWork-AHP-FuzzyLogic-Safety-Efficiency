# FAIRWork-AHP-and-FuzzyLogic

Developers: [Zi Xuan(Melody) Tung]([https://github.com/](https://github.com/melody-tung)), [Alexander Nasuta](https://github.com/Alexander-Nasuta)

## Features

- Calculate efficiency and safety ratings for your workspace.
- Customize inputs such as robot mode, cycle time, layout, robot movement, gripper choice, space requirement, human traffic, automation skill of workers, safety requirements, and quantity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually included with Python)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sylwia-Olbrych/FAIRWork-AHP-FuzzyLogic-Safety-Efficiency.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the application using Python 
4. The GUI window will open with sliders and options to customize your workspace inputs.
5. Adjust the sliders and options according to your workspace setup.
6. Click the "Calculate" button to get efficiency and safety ratings.
7. A new window will pop up displaying the efficiency and safety ratings for your workspace.
8. Close the output window when you are done reviewing the ratings.


## Input Parameters
**Robot Mode**: Choose between "Cooperative" and "Collaborative" robot modes.<br />
**Cycle Time**: Set the cycle time for your workspace.<br />
**Layout**: Rate the layout of your workspace on a scale from 1 to 10.<br />
**Robot Movement**: Rate the robot movement in your workspace on a scale from 1 to 10.<br />
**Gripper Choice**: Choose a gripper type from the available options.<br />
**Space Requirement**: Rate the space requirement of your workspace on a scale from 1 to 10.<br />
**Human Traffic**: Rate the human traffic in your workspace on a scale from 1 to 10.<br />
**Automation Skill**: Rate the automation skill of your workers on a scale from 1 to 10.<br />
**Safety Requirements**: Rate the safety requirements of your workspace on a scale from 1 to 10.<br />
**Quantity**: Set the quantity of items to be produced or processed.<br />

## Output
The tool will display the following ratings:<br />

**Efficiency**: An efficiency rating based on the provided inputs.<br />
**Safety**: A safety rating based on the provided inputs.<br />
